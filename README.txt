== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= A question that someone might have =

An answer to that question.

= How does AIWIS know my customer’s name? =

AIWIS is passed information from the autoresponder (if your customer arrived through an e-mail link) or from Facebook (if they didn’t).
So when you use the [NAME] shortcode in your AIWIS message, it’ll just be replaced witht he actual name of your prospect.
